Processing:

* Get list of core packages
* Add core packages as strict dependencies
* Load up package index
* Calculate matches using newest versions of packages
* Write out a YAML file with all that information
* Verify that the build plan can be compiled
    * Optional: check with cabal-install as well
* Perform the build
